This plugin has to collect a lot of data from Facebook in order to work front-end. Usually the data is only fetched
once per session. It is then cached in files in this directory and outputted as JavaScript globals in the <head> 
of the page for quick and easy access.

This directory needs to be writable for the plugin to work.
